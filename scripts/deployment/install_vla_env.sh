# Build a standalone venv for online VLA inference from scratch. Two tracks are supported:
#   --track libero-pro   LIBERO-Pro simulation + Pi0.5 (Zetta OpenPI backend)
#   --track robocasa     RoboCasa simulation + GR00T
#
# Every step in this script corresponds to a command executed and validated on a real GPU
# host, including fixes for several bugs encountered along the way (not theoretical
# speculation). See VLA_ENV_SETUP.md in this directory for the full background.
#
# The two tracks share most of their infrastructure (venv creation, mujoco==3.3.1,
# installation of this repository's rollout_runtime, the pydantic/numpydantic fix,
# and the robocasa/gr00t top-level package shadowing fix). They are mutually exclusive
# at the code level in one place and must branch there:
#
#   robosuite version: LIBERO-Pro's liberopro.liberopro.envs.bddl_base_domain.
#   BDDLBaseDomain directly inherits robosuite.environments.manipulation.
#   single_arm_env.SingleArmEnv (this class was removed entirely in robosuite==1.5.x
#   and refactored into manipulation_env.ManipulationEnv), while RoboCasa requires the
#   PandaOmron robot class introduced in robosuite>=1.5.0. The two cannot coexist in
#   the same venv state; select one with the --track argument.
#
# Validated combinations (independently tested for both tracks on the same machine
# with a single GPU):
#   libero-pro: mujoco==3.3.1 + robosuite==1.4.1 + liberopro==0.1.1
#               + rlinf-openpi==0.1.1 (real openpi/pi0.5 inference)
#   robocasa:   mujoco==3.3.1 + robosuite==1.5.2 + robocasa==1.0.1
#               + gr00t==1.1.0 + flash-attn==2.8.3
#
# ROBOCASA_SRC_ROOT compatibility matrix (robocasa track only):
#
#   robosuite/, robocasa/, and Isaac-GR00T/ under ROBOCASA_SRC_ROOT are installed
#   editable straight from source (see step 3/9, 3.1/9, 5/9 below) -- none of the
#   three publish to PyPI for this track, and nothing in this script told you which
#   commit/branch of each repo produces the versions pinned above (the "robosuite
#   is not 1.5.x" / "robocasa's kitchen.py needs PandaOmron" checks below only
#   catch the mismatch after checkout + install + pip's dependency resolution has
#   already run, i.e. late). Check out exactly these refs instead of "main":
#
#     robosuite/    https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite
#                   tag v1.5.2 (824ac14cefcfb7ec125fe5eb2e0bad7364466154) -> robosuite==1.5.2
#     robocasa/     https://github.com/robocasa/robocasa
#                   commit 29f7ce8814c1547f5af762a0997fbd4b64848dd7 -> robocasa==1.0.1
#     Isaac-GR00T/  https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T
#                   tag n1.5-release (4af2b622892f7dcb5aae5a3fb70bcb02dc217b96) -> gr00t==1.1.0
#
#   e.g.:
#     git clone https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite "$ROBOCASA_SRC_ROOT/robosuite" \
#       && git -C "$ROBOCASA_SRC_ROOT/robosuite" checkout v1.5.2
#     git clone https://github.com/robocasa/robocasa "$ROBOCASA_SRC_ROOT/robocasa" \
#       && git -C "$ROBOCASA_SRC_ROOT/robocasa" checkout 29f7ce8814c1547f5af762a0997fbd4b64848dd7
#     git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T "$ROBOCASA_SRC_ROOT/Isaac-GR00T" \
#       && git -C "$ROBOCASA_SRC_ROOT/Isaac-GR00T" checkout n1.5-release
#
#   Notes on how these three refs were picked (each repo versions differently,
#   and none of it is obvious from a fresh checkout):
#     - robosuite tags its releases 1:1 with the PyPI-style version string, so
#       v1.5.2 is unambiguous.
#     - robocasa has no v1.0.1 tag -- only v1.0 (== 1.0.0) and v0.2 exist. The
#       commit above is the earliest one on its main branch whose setup.py
#       already reads version="1.0.1"; anything from that commit onward
#       reports the same version.
#     - Isaac-GR00T's release tags do NOT correlate with the version string in
#       pyproject.toml (n1.6-release and n1.7-release both report 0.1.0);
#       n1.5-release is the only tag whose pyproject.toml reports 1.1.0. As a
#       cross-check, n1.5-release's own pyproject.toml independently pins
#       pydantic==2.10.6 and transformers==4.51.3 -- exactly the versions
#       steps 5.3/9 and 5.4/9 below force-reinstall after GR00T's own install
#       runs. If you check out a different Isaac-GR00T ref and that agreement
#       breaks, treat it as a signal you have the wrong commit, not as this
#       script being wrong.
#   These refs were resolved by matching each project's own reported version
#   string against its GitHub tag/commit history, not by re-running this exact
#   three-repo combination through this script end to end -- if you hit a new
#   failure with the exact refs above, it is real, not "just try a different
#   commit."

# Usage:

#     bash install_vla_env.sh --track robocasa
#
# Optional environment variables:
#   PYTHON_BIN            Path to the system python3.10 executable (default: python3.10)
#   LIBERO_COMPOSITE_ASSETS_DIR
#                         libero-pro track only: destination for the composite asset
#                         tree (robosuite robot models + LIBERO-Pro scene/object assets).
#                         Defaults to $VENV_ROOT/libero-pro-composite-assets. For a real
#                         rollout, set LIBERO_ASSETS_ROOT_OVERRIDE to this directory
#                         (see the "Next steps" example below). Do not use the raw output
#                         of liberopro-download-assets alone: it does not include the
#                         robot models bundled with robosuite (such as
#                         robots/panda/robot.xml), so environment reset would raise
#                         FileNotFoundError.
#   SKIP_ASSET_DOWNLOAD   Set to 1 to skip downloading LIBERO-Pro assets and building
#                         the composite asset tree (libero-pro track; use when the
#                         assets have already been prepared elsewhere)
#   ROBOCASA_SRC_ROOT     Required for the robocasa track: root of a source checkout
#                         containing the robocasa/, robosuite/, and Isaac-GR00T/
#                         subdirectories (each is an editable installation source).
#                         See the "ROBOCASA_SRC_ROOT compatibility matrix" section
#                         above for the exact git ref each subdirectory must be
#                         checked out to.
#   FLASH_ATTN_WHEEL      Optional for the robocasa track: local path or URL of a
#                         prebuilt flash-attn wheel. By default, the version table below
#                         is used to construct a GitHub Release URL. Set this explicitly
#                         when the build host cannot reach github.com (an internal mirror
#                         or file:// path may be used)
#   LIBEROPRO_PACKAGE     Optional for the libero-pro track: pip requirement for the
#                         upstream LIBERO-Pro package. Defaults to rlinf-liberopro==0.1.1;
#                         override it with a full URL when using an internal mirror.
#
# Prerequisites (validated on Ubuntu 22.04; verify package names on other distributions):
#   - python3.10 + python3.10-venv
#   - build-essential (gcc is required to compile numba/native extensions)
#   - libegl1-mesa-dev / libgl1-mesa-dev (MuJoCo EGL offscreen rendering)
#   - git (required to install RoboCasa / robosuite / GR00T from source)
#   - NVIDIA driver installed and `nvidia-smi` available; CUDA 12.6 series
#     (torch==2.7.1+cu126)
#
# Outside this script's scope and must be provided by the user:
#   - VLA checkpoint (the actual weight file referenced by --model-path)
#   - Source checkout for the robocasa track (ROBOCASA_SRC_ROOT)
