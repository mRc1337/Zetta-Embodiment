"""``RuntimeRolloutWorker``.

Runs as a serving system: keeps the policy loaded persistently, consumes
``InferenceRequest`` from multiple EnvWorkers, and routes results back to the
originating EnvWorker by ``routing_token``. **A complete episode never enters the
RolloutWorker** — it only ever sees a continuous stream of ordinary inference
requests.

The M3 shape (M2 only wired things together, without batching):

| Method | Shape |
|---|---|
| ``init_worker`` / ``infer_batch`` / ``send_responses`` | Same as M2 |
| ``serve`` | Two persistent loops: ``receive_requests`` ‖ ``execute_batches`` |
| ``receive_requests`` | Competitively get from ``rr_infer_req["pending"]`` → record ``routing_token`` → **enqueue into the scheduler** |
| ``execute_batches`` | Pull a batch bucketed by ``compat_key`` (``max_batch_size`` / ``max_wait_ms`` / priority / tenant fairness), one task per batch |
| ``update_weights`` | The scheduler's version fence: raise fence → wait for in-flight to drain → swap weights → lower fence |

Fetching is constrained by **two gates**; once either is saturated, no more requests
are pulled from the channel, letting the bounded ``rr_infer_req`` back up to maxsize
and propagating backpressure to the EnvWorker: ``max_concurrent_inferences`` (total
accepted so far, present since M2) and ``SchedulerConfig.max_queue_depth`` (the
scheduler's watermark).

All public methods must be total functions.
