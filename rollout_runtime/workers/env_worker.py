"""``RuntimeEnvWorker``.

The M1 deliverable is "complete method signatures + a ``handle_command`` dispatch
skeleton"; the real execution body lands in M2 (fake backend) and M4 (rlinf env).

Three finalized shape constraints:

- **Total functions**: every public method wraps its body in
  ``try/except BaseException``, normalizing exceptions into a
  ``ResultEnvelope(error=...)`` return value, **never raising**. The reason is that
  ``WorkerGroupFuncResult._wait_for_results`` calls ``os.kill(pid, SIGUSR1)`` on a
  remote exception — a single failed request would kill the whole job.
- **Interface isomorphic to rlinf's ``ToolWorker``**
  (``workers/agent/tool_worker.py:33``): ``init_worker(channels)`` /
  ``start_server()`` / ``stop_server()`` + a persistent ``_process_requests()``
  loop.
- **Env slots are pre-allocated pool indices**: ``num_envs`` is baked in at env
  construction time, the pool is built once up front with ``pool_size`` slots, a
  session binds to ``(pool_key, slot_index)``, and ``binding_token`` is an opaque
  uuid.

The late-arrival discard logic mirrors the structure of
``rlinf/workers/env/rtc_env_worker.py:217::RTCEnvWorker.evaluate`` (``chunk_id``
late-rejection + overlapping ``pending_response``).

This module does not import ``ray`` / ``rlinf`` at the top level: subclassing
rlinf's ``Worker`` is wrapped with a lazy import in the M3 launch layer, so that
``.venv-runtime`` (without rlinf) can still run the M2 inproc e2e.

        construction is blocking and can take tens of seconds), while

        command spawns its own task). The original implementation called

        concurrent bindings would **all** see "the pool does not exist yet",

        A ``lockstep_vector`` pool advances **all** lanes in a single

        but ``run_lockstep_chunk`` only returns a ``ChunkOutcome`` to
        participants, and ``_step_slot`` only updates the ``SessionSlot`` of the
        submitter. Skipping this readback has three consequences, none of which
        are "reordering" but rather "stale state":

        1. ``last_observation`` goes stale → ``policy_step`` feeds an old frame
           into inference (the original implementation only patched this in
           ``observe``, not in ``policy_step``);
        2. ``terminated`` / ``truncated`` lag behind → the core-side lane is
           already ``frozen``, but the worker-side ``_require_running_episode``
           still lets it through, so the next ``chunk_step`` call for that lane
           takes the ``if lane.frozen: continue`` branch, returning
           ``executed_horizon=0`` with ``terminated`` still false — **an
           already-successful termination gets silently dropped**, violating the
           hard rule that "success is determined solely by the environment's
           termination signal";
        3. ``_lockstep_lane_count`` keeps counting this already-terminated lane
           as "running", so every subsequent group has to wait it out to the
           ``coalesce_window_ms`` timeout before firing.

        Because point 3 requires **whole-pool** truth, this simply reads back
        all lanes of the pool at once and syncs every ``SessionSlot`` bound to
        that pool: ``lane_status`` does not render or encode images, so reading
        1 lane costs the same as reading 4, and this also saves a second pool
        lock acquisition that a "sync myself, then separately count everyone

        A vector pool adds one extra termination path: this lane may be carried
        to termination by a hold action **while absent**. That termination is
        only discovered by a readback inside the loop, surfacing as

        an error on the caller's part, nor an invalid episode — "success is
        determined solely by the environment's termination signal" — so it is
        folded here into a normal termination; otherwise ``eval_adapter`` would
        record it as ``Err`` with ``valid=False``, erasing a genuinely
        successful environment outcome from the denominator of the success
        rate. Conversely, an episode that has already ended **before** entering
        this method is still a caller error (consistent with ``policy_step`` /
