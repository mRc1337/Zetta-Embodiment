"""The env family registry.

``EnvFamilyAdapter`` absorbs family differences (reset signature,
``chunk_step`` return length, obs extraction, action preprocessing, device,
privileged extensions); each family registers one instance into
``ENV_FAMILY_REGISTRY``. The Gateway validates against the capability table
at ``create_session`` time, returning ``UNSUPPORTED_ENV_SPEC`` for
unsupported cases instead of failing at runtime.

The registry mechanism and Protocol live here; this module also holds the
**declarative branches for real families**
(``ENV_FAMILY_BEHAVIORS``): each family's ``reset`` signature, how many obs
``chunk_step`` returns, whether actions are numpy or torch, whether an
accelerator is needed, and which privileged extensions exist. Separating
declaration from implementation means neither the Gateway nor the
EnvWorker needs an ``if env_family == ...`` branch, and a family that is
"declared but not implemented in this build" (currently only
``robotwin``, whose package is absent from the validated runtime images)
gets a clear ``UNSUPPORTED_ENV_SPEC`` + ``declared=True`` instead of a
``KeyError``.

"""The full names of LIBERO's privileged methods.

An undeclared method always returns ``UNSUPPORTED_EXTENSION`` (rather than
crashing). All are read-only, so ``EXTENSION_CALL`` neither occupies
``operation_seq`` nor requires a prior reset.

``libero.critic_state`` mirrors the legacy
``robots/libero/env_client.py::privileged_critic_state``: it reads the
current privileged Critic state independently of ``chunk_step``
(diagnostic scripts and cross-branch parity comparisons need to read it
at any point in time, not only the automatic call inside
``_chunk_step_one`` on every step). The ``reset_tracker`` parameter is
passed through to ``libero_privileged.CRITIC_STATE_METHOD``; the caller
controls whether to clear cross-call history, which is an independent
path from the automatic ``critic_history_pending_reset`` semantics inside
``_chunk_step_one`` -- the two are separate paths that do not interfere
with each other (both are bound to the same ``_rr_critic_history`` state
on the subprocess side, but are cleared at different times by two
separate explicit requests).

``libero.raw_obs`` is a required legacy seam: ``robots/libero/tools.py``
has 10 motion primitives that read ``env.raw_obs()`` directly for
``robot0_eef_quat`` / ``robot0_eef_pos`` / ``robot0_gripper_qpos``, plus
``agentview_image`` / ``agentview_depth`` / ``robot0_eye_in_hand_image`` /
``robot0_eye_in_hand_depth`` and "object keys ending in ``_pos``"
(``view_driver_state`` relies on it to list ``object_names``).
``Observation.state``'s 8 dimensions (eef_pos + quat2axisangle +
gripper_qpos) **carry insufficient information**: axisangle cannot recover
the sign of the quat, and there are no images or depth at all.

Stage 7).

Both methods are existing ``RoboCasaSession`` entry points also used by
``env_server.py``; Stage 7 makes them reachable through the sole Runtime
path as well, not only directly over HTTP:

- ``robocasa.snapshot(include_images: bool)`` ->
  ``RoboCasaSession.snapshot``: Role1's visual review
  (``role1_actor.decide_action(observation_response=...)``) and Gen0's
  ``initial_observation_identity`` both need this one payload of
  **raw named state + data-URL images**. ``Observation`` cannot hold it:
  ``state`` is a flat vector (dropping key names), and images are PNG
  ``PayloadRef`` (hashed from a different source than the JPEG data URL in
  the audit record). Going through this extension means the evidence
  bytes Role1 receives are identical before and after migration, without
  having to reimplement the encoding on the application side.
- ``robocasa.finalize_episode()`` ->
  ``RoboCasaSession.finalize_episode_artifacts``: video is only flushed
  to disk here (``_close_video_writers``), and
  ``zetta.evolution.trajectory`` requires the episode video to exist and
  be non-empty. Without this, an episode can never reach finalization.

``release`` is **not** an extension method: in the direct-connection era,
``RoboCasaEnvClient.release()``'s semantics were "return the slot binding
for reuse by the next rollout process", which in the Runtime is
``close_sessions`` (the Gateway's binding + ``EnvPool.release``); adding
another synonymous extension would only create two coexisting release
paths.
